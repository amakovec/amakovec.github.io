Hi!  I'm a hardware engineer with extensive experience in designing development boards, writing scripts for test automation, and creating test cases for board bring-up, design verification, and EMC.

## Experience

### Hardware Engineer at Rockwell Automation (May 2019 - Present)

* Designed several development boards to enable test automation in early prototype and final test stages for a series of new I/O products:
    * Designed for requirements such as multiple isolation zones, 12+ high-speed signals, and several power integrity requirements, resulting in designs of 200+ components per board.
    * Oversaw layout performed by a separate layout designer.  Facilitated resolution of placement conflicts.
    * Designed a quick-turn PCB to test a high-risk subcircuit. Created and executed test cases to verify the subcircuit.
    * Led DMI review and PCB DFM processes, and assisted in material ordering and organizing production runs.
    * Created test cases for board bring-up and design verification test, and oversaw execution of tests.
* Designed and implemented Python scripts for test automation and results analysis:
    * Designed a Python script to capture test results from multiple pieces of test equipment and generate a test report containing 3000+ data points.  Included a GUI for use by technicians.
    * Designed a Python script to visualize backplane communication failures with a heatmap.
* EMC test plan generation (IEC 61000), specifically with regards to ensuring hardware was exercised to functional requirements while under exposure to noise:
    * Designed and implemented Ladder Logic (Allen-Bradley) for test automation.
    * Coordinated flashing of firmware and installation of software to 8 early prototype test setups in order to enable preliminary EMC testing.
* Member of a cross-functional SAFe Agile team (hardware, firmware, and software), collaborating with other teams (~150 person project) to develop a series of 10+ products.
* Served as Scrum Master (50/50 time split with technical work above, Sept 2019 - Sept 2020):
    * Led sprint planning and daily stand-ups, assisted in backlog grooming, and prepared stories and metrics in Jira.
    * Delivered bi-weekly readout presentations to an audience of ~150 people, covering a mix of technical progress and agile metrics.

### Hardware Engineering Co-Op at Rockwell Automation (Jan 2018 - Aug 2018)

* Performed EMC Testing of Ethernet-enabled embedded systems products to qualify conformance to the IEC 61000-6-4 standard, including configuring PLCs to automate the testing process.
* Oversaw the hardware-related aspects of a quality control revision of a legacy embedded systems product including DMI review, PCB DFM process, prototype/pilot runs, and last-time buy considerations.
* Investigated viability of potential cost savings in new Ethernet ICs by testing for conformance to IEEE 802.3.
* Designed and analyzed possible PCB layouts to solve space constraint issues in a new product under development.
* Mentored a team of 3 engineering interns on a long-term embedded systems design project.

## Skills

* **Design Capture**: Mentor Graphics proficiency (Xpedition design capture flow, HyperLynx SI/PI modeling, library management), KiCAD competency (design capture and library management)
* **Programming Languages**: Python proficiency, C/C++ and Java familiarity
* **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, and GitLab competency
* **Other Skills**: Linux, Jira, MATLAB, SAP ECC, Rockwell Software (Studio 5000, RSLinx, FactoryTalk)
